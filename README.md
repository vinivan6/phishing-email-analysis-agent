# Phishing Email Analysis Agent

A Python and FastAPI-based cybersecurity application that analyzes suspicious emails and produces a structured phishing risk assessment using rule-based detection, threat-intelligence enrichment, semantic classification, and decision logic.

## Features

- Analyze emails through a FastAPI backend
- Use Streamlit as a simple front-end interface
- Support manual email input
- Support `.eml` email upload
- Extract artifacts such as:
  - URLs
  - domains
  - IP addresses
  - attachment names
  - phone numbers
  - monetary amounts
- Detect phishing indicators such as:
  - urgency
  - credential requests
  - suspicious URLs
  - lookalike domains
  - reply-to mismatch
  - SPF/DKIM failures
  - job scam patterns
  - help desk scam patterns
  - extortion / blackmail patterns
- Enrich results using external reputation sources:
  - VirusTotal
  - URLhaus
  - AbuseIPDB
  - AlienVault OTX
- Classify email semantics into categories such as:
  - newsletter_marketing
  - credential_phishing
  - extortion_blackmail
  - job_scam
  - helpdesk_support_scam
  - uncertain
- Produce:
  - verdict
